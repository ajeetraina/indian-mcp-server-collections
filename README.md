# Indian MCP Server Collections

<img width="470" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-11 at 10 47 45 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8606e27b-241b-46c8-929d-a3e372152080" />

A curated collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers related to India. This repository serves as a central hub for discovering and using MCP servers that provide India-specific services and data.

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between AI models (like Claude, GPT) and external data sources and tools. It allows AI assistants to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations.

Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications:
- Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect devices to peripherals, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools
- This enables AI models to access real-time information and perform actions in the real world
- MCP servers can run locally or in the cloud, providing a secure bridge between AI models and services
